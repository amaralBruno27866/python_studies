**4.** 

Explain why search through a balanced Binary Search tree is O(log n)?

**5.**

**6.** 

Given the following declaration of a binary search tree:
```python
class BST:
	class Node:
		# Node's init function
		def __init__(self, value=None, left=None, right=None):
			self.value = value
			self.left = left
			self.right = right

	#BST's init function
	def __init__(self):
		self.root = None
```
Write the following member function of BST.

```python
def print_between(min, max): 
```
This function prints every value in the tree that is between min and max inclusive. 
Function only visits a subtree where the values may be valid.

**7.** Given the following declaration of a binary tree:
```python
class BT:
	class Node:
		# Node's init function

			self.right = right

	#BT's init function
	def __init__(self):
		self.root = None
```
Write the BT class method:
```python

```
This method returns the height of the binary tree.

10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 46, 56, 44, 48, 49

**15.**

Suppose you are given the list: [15, 12, 14, 11, 10, 9, 7, 5, 2, 1].  
Draw the complete binary tree associated with the list. 

**15b.**

Make heap in place using the heapify algorithm on the list in part 13a to form a **min-heap**.  Draw the final heap and state the final list created from the heapify routine.  

**16.**

Given the following BST class declaration

```python
class BST:
	class Node:
		# Node's init function
		def __init__(self, value=None, left=None, right=None):
			self.value = value
			self.left = left
			self.right = right

	#BST's init function
	def __init__(self):
		self.root = None
```

Write the BST class method:
```python
def inorder_successor(self, value):
```
This method returns the inorder successor of value. If there are no nodes with this value in the BST, or the node containing this value does not have an inorder succesor, this method should return None.
